					But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born
					and I
					will give you a complete account of the system. and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of
					truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
					because
					it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
					consequences
					that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of
					itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can
					procure
					him some great pleasure. To take a trivial, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise,
					except
					to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a
					pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
					On
					the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
					demoralized
					by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot forsee
